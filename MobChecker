.SYNOPSIS
    check whether mob is disable don the esxi host or not.
.DESCRIPTION
    it connects to the vcenter server, creates a list of hostnames and converts them into the urls to check mob.
    unfortunately it is not working the way i intended. someone can help me use the output of the url to 
    confirm mob or till then use it the way it is.
    If the output contains (404) not found then mob is disabled.
    anything other than that means mob is enabled.
